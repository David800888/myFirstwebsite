                and I were able to make a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.<br>
                My group consisting of Rene, Daniel, Kendric and I<br>
                and we edited our code on <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/tic-tac-toe-p5?path=sketch.js%3A1%3A0">glitch</a> instead of github.<br>
                But we were able to make a game that kept the score<br>
                and alternated between X's and O's. And it was very<br>
                fun to work on. So click the link to look at the code

            <p class="text2">Using only HTML and CSS, I was able to<br>
                make a copy of the McDonalds Website. It was<br>
                not an exact copy but I think I did a pretty<br>
                good job for my first time. If you want to check<br>
                out my first attempt at a Website, here is the link<br>
                to my <a href="https://github.com/David800888/MCDonnys">github</a> and maybe give some suggestions<br>
                on how I can improve, because no idea is a bad idea<br>
